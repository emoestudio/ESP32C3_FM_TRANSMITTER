Instructions for adding the Coilcraft logo:

1. Download the Coilcraft logo from their official website (https://www.coilcraft.com/)
2. Save the logo as "coilcraft_logo.png" in this directory (img/)
3. The logo should be in PNG format with a transparent background if possible
4. A recommended size would be around 200-300px wide for proper display in the README

The Coilcraft logo is used in the README files to acknowledge their sponsorship and their 0805HP series ceramic chip inductors used in this project.
